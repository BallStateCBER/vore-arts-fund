            The Vore Arts Fund is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit program for supporting the Muncie arts community
            by distributing no-contract, no-interest loans to cover the up-front costs of producing commercial
            art, music, performances, and educational opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're currently fundraising and setting up the program's website, and applications for funding are
            not yet open to the public. Stay tuned for updates.
